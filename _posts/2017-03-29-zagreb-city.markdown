description: During the second year of my studies, I was introduced to Object-Oriented programming and learned the basics of Java through different assignments. I also created HTML5 games, that can be found on my github page, with a game framework called "Phaser". In addition, I learned the basics of networking and developed a server-client chat using Java.
