description: In 2016, I started my studies in the Department of Informatics at Ionian University. During that year I started coding in C/C++ and have created/contributed to various projects since then. I also attended several seminars such as a lecture by Clifford Kentros about "Transgenic investigation of neural circuits" and an event held by Google called "Grow Greek Tourism Online".
